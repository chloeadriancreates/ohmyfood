## Presentation
*This is a fictional project, which started as project 3 of my OpenClassrooms front-end development program, made with HTML and Sass. I decided to remake it with React, Redux and Sass, using my new skills. You can visit this new version [here](https://ohmyfood.chloeadrian.dev/)!* \
Ohmyfood is a platform that lets clients choose and order meals they will eat at a restaurant in advance. Each restaurant has a menu page, with their dishes sorted in categories. The user can like their favorite restaurants, as well as add dishes to their cart and see their order total by restaurant.
